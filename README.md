# Network-Messaging-CLI-tool
download zig 0.15

run zig build

launch executable. without any flags will run in auto mode. auto mode runs on port 12987 and tries to connect to yourself

with flags can run on a custom port and connect to whatever address you want.

after connecting can send messages betwen client and host, type status for connection info, type quit to quit (^C also works)
